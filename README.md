# holbertonschool_low_level_programming
In this folder, you will find a sample of what i did at holbertonschool.
There were a lot of more project and all were based on practice. Like in the professional world, the solution were never given and we had to solve problems by ourselve.

In all of that topics, i had between 5-20 exercises to learn the concepts. On every exercise we had to create a functional code. After that the memory concept were learned, all exercises had to be with no memory leaks and correctly free. 

In all of the C exercises, we could only use a library that we have already coded. For example until we have not code by ourself the functions strdup we could not use it.

We also had to follow the syntax rules given by the school. ( maximun of 60 line by function, maximun of 3 functions, everything free, and a uniform syntax)
